      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>Even before Alberta became a province in September 1905, the citizens of a very young Calgary were determined to host a post-secondary institution as part of building a great city.</p>
      <p>In 1906, the Alberta Normal School (which would later become our own Werklund School of Education) began operations and provided a steady stream of educators for a new province eager to grow and advance quickly.</p>
      <p>When the University of Alberta was founded in 1908 in Strathcona (now part of Edmonton), Calgarians were disappointed with the "branch plant" concept that ensued and lobbied for decades for an independent institution of their own...</p>
      <p>In 2016-17, the University of Calgary marked its 50th Anniversary as an autonomous institution.</p>
